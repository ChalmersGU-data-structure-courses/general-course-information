# Information about the labs

We have **four compulsory laborations** that give you hands-on experience with key concepts from the course.
These laborations are programming projects, but also include textual reasoning parts.
We offer each lab in Java and Python (you can choose).
The laborations do not have a grade, but you have to **pass** all of them:

- The first lab is a short **individual** coding exercise to introduce you to the lab system.
- Labs 2–4 are longer projects done in **groups of three**.
  For these, you must also pass a live supervision checkpoint (see below).

You can discuss the lab problems with students outside your lab group.
You can discuss strategies on a high level.
But you are **not allowed to give away any solutions**!
We take plagiarism seriously (see Lab 3).
Everything you do must be your **own work**.
In particular, you are not allowed to use tools that write code for you (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.).

***Note for DAT525***:
This course is smaller, so you do not have to submit the final assignment (lab 4, path finder).

## Schedule

Here is a very rough schedule for the labs, but please see your Canvas pages for more detailed deadlines.
Note that the deadlines are strict!

| Lab                         | Published    | First deadline | Mid deadline | Final deadline |
|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Lab 1: Binary search        | Course start | Week 2         | Week 3       | Week 4         |
| Lab 2: Text indexing        | Week 2       | Week 3         | Week 4       | Week 5         |
| Lab 3: Plagiarism detection | Week 4       | Week 5         | Week 6       | Week 7         |
| Lab 4: Path finder          | Week 6       | Week 7         | Week 8       | Exam week      |

You **must** submit something before the first deadline, even if it is not fully complete (you will get feedback for the parts you have done).
You **must** have a passing submission before the final deadline.
In addition there is a mid deadline: if you submit before you will get intermediate feedback.

- You can override a submission by making a new submission, if you do it before the deadline.
- The deadline for submissions is 19:00, so don't work late hours!

## The lab system

The lab projects are shared, submitted, and graded on [Chalmers GitLab](https://git.chalmers.se/dashboard/projects).
This is a collaborative platform for software development similar to GitHub and Bitbucket, but hosted privately by Chalmers.

The full process is described on a separate page, but briefly:

- We add you to a lab project on Chalmers GitLab.
- You submit by creating a *tag* named `submission(Something)`.
  Watch for spelling mistakes!
- A *merge request* will be opened for your submission.
  Graders give feedback by performing a code review there.
- You discuss with your grader by participating in the merge request discussion.
- Robograder can test your code before you submit if you create a tag named *test-(Something)*.

More information is on the page [Working with Chalmers GitLab](chalmers-gitlab.md).

## Joining a group

Labs 2–4 are done in **groups of three**.

- We recommend to form a diverse team and decide on set working times.
- Work together, never alone.
  The member with the least coding experience should be writing the code, coached by the others.
- You can ask for partners on the dedicated discussion channel (see your specific Canvas page), or ask to be assigned by the course-responsible teacher.

Once you have formed a group, assign yourselves to a free lab group in Canvas: go to the *People* page and select the *Groups* tab.
You will be added to the lab project on Chalmers GitLab as soon as it is published.

**Note**:
All group members need to actively contribute to the whole submission and be able to explain all your work.
If you have trouble with a slacking member, contact the course responsible.

**Note**:
If you want to switch to a different group for the next lab, move yourself to that group in Canvas.

## Supervision

We offer **lab supervision sessions each week** where you can (and should!) get help from course assistants.
You can choose which and how many you want to attend. Consult TimeEdit to find them. 

During each session, we maintain a **queue** of supervision requests.
See your specific Canvas page for more information.

To get a live supervision meeting, simply post your name (Lab 1) or group number (Labs 2–4) and where we can find you (for online requests, this should be a Zoom link).
A course assistant will join you as soon as possible.

- The course assistants mark handled requests using emojis.
  From this, you can see how far in the queue you are.
- When it is not busy, you can also just talk to the assistants. 

**Note**: You can always use the course discussion channels to get help.
Outside the lab sessions, it may take longer to get an answer.

## Supervision checkpoint

For Labs 2–4, you must pass a **live supervision checkpoint**.
This is to demonstrate that all group members contributed to and understand the whole submission.

- Ask for a supervision checkpoint like you would for an ordinary supervision meeting.
  This can also be online.
- You need to finish **at least half** of a lab to be eligible for the supervision checkpoint.
  If you are stuck before, please reach out during the lab sessions.
- Consider doing the supervision checkpoint before your first submission.
  It might help you catch mistakes.
- **All group members** must be present in the meeting and able to answer individually.
  Expect questions about parts other group members have written.

Of course, you can ask for regular supervision as many times as you like, independent of the checkpoint.
