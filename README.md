# Data structures and algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental building blocks in almost all software products. Knowledge of data abstraction, data structures, and algorithms is important in the construction, use, and maintenance of adaptable, reusable, and efficient program components.

The course gives knowledge and skills in the construction and use of data structures and algorithmic concepts, and gives an introduction to algorithm analysis and data abstraction.

Here you can find general information that are common to (almost) all courses in data structures and algorithms, given at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg (GU).

***Note***: The information in these pages is not accurate for the course DIT962!

- Here is the [official syllabus for all courses except DIT962](syllabus.md).
- And here is the [official syllabus for DIT962](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT962.pdf).

## Teacher team

The following are the team of teachers giving the different course instances. We develop the courses collaboratively.

- Peter Ljunglöf
- Jonas Duregård
- Christian Sattler
- Hazem Torfah
- Alex Gerdes

## Organisation and examination

The course consists of two "modules": one (4.5hp) is the written examination, and one (3.0hp) are the assignments. (Except the course DAT525 which only has 1.5hp assignments)

### Literature

- The [course literature and additional reading tips](literature.md) are covered in a separate page.

### Lectures

- On average three times per week. The may include some exercises.
- For more details, see the Canvas page for your course.

### Assignments

- There are 4 compulsory assignments (called laborations).
  - DAT525 only has 3 assignments (the 4th one is not included). This is because DAT525 only gives 6.0hp, while the other ones give 7.5hp.
- Every assignment has two main deadlines:
  - You must submit something for the first deadline, even if it's not working.
  - The teachers grade and comment on the first submission, and if it's not accepted, you have until the final deadline to correct your solution.
- The first laboration is individual.
- The laborations 2–4 are done in groups of at most 3 students.
- The labs can be done in Java or Python, and it's up to the lab group to decide.
- There are lab supervision sessions where you can get help from course assistants.
- The labs/assignments are not graded, but you have to pass all of them.
- In addition, you have to complete individual Canvas quizzes to get a passing grade on the assignments.

More information:
- [Information about the labs](lab-info.md)
- [Working with Chalmers GitLab](chalmers-gitlab.md)

### Weekly exercises

- Every week we will publish new quizzes and exercises which will help you in your learning.

### Written examination

- Information about [the exam and how the grade is calculated](exam-info.md).
- Detailed list of [what topics you should know for the exam](exam-topics.md).
- A repository of [past exams](https://github.com/ChalmersGU-data-structure-courses/past-exams).

Upcoming exam dates:
- 2024: 11 January, 12 March, 30 May, 22 August, 27 October
- 2025: 16 January, 5 June, 21 August, end of October (date not decided yet)

### Passing the course

- To pass the course you need to pass all 4 laborations (or 3 for DAT525), and the written examination.
- The final grade is the same as the grade on the written examination.
